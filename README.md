# Chinese-NLP_Buddhist-Texts
This proof-of-concept notebook uses a (Modern) Chinese SpaCy library as a base to tokenize and analyze parts of speech for a short Buddhist text. Mistakes in the tags were corrected by hand to train an improved model for Pre-Modern Literary Chinese Texts. It was built with Pandas, SpaCy, Xiaoquan Kong's Chinese SpaCy models. It implements a Part of Speech tagger and visualizations using diSplaCy.
